# GCP code samples

This repo contains scripts and templates to ease setting up and performing actions for some of the products in GCP. Basically it is a place to come and take initial fast samples to develop new code.

It contains some simple scenarios I thought up, to be used to deliver GCP trainings.

It also reproduces some Quickstarts already present in the GCP documentation, which, even though they are step by step guides sometimes are not so obvious for new cloud acolytes. Mostly I made them to explain to myself and others how each Quickstart works and learn what are they really doing in them. Also fix some errors in some Quickstarts and fill in the gaps omitted or not explained.
