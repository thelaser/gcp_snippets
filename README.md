# GCP code samples

This repo contains scripts and templates to ease setting up and performing actions for some of the products in GCP. Basically it is a place to come and take initial fast samples to develop new code.

It contains some simple scenarios I thought about, to deliver GCP trainings too.  

It also reproduces some Quickstarts already present in the GCP documentation. Mostly I made them to explain to myself how each Quickstart works and learn what are they really doing in them.
